SunRecognizeLaughter Eventify Project Management Summary
=======================
A document briefly outlining how your team managed the progression of tasks and the sharing of source code. You may wish to draw on
concepts such as Scrum. You should describe how your team used version control such as Git.

**Managing the Progression of Tasks**
---------------
The SunRecognizeLaughter team utilised the scrum framework to complete the assignment, as it allowed us to inspect working software throughout development. Each sprint consisted of completing certain tasks from the product backlog, which was simply a list shared amongst developers using Google Docs. These tasks we delegated to each team member, and committed to the project once they were completed. The progression of tasks was also managed through regular group calls using the Zoom platform. This platform was chosen because it allowed us to share our screen, which was extremely helpful in solving logic errors in the code as a group. It was in these calls that tasks for the sprint were identified and delegated, accompanied with a deadline. After this deadline, we would meet on Zoom again and choose the next tasks to complete. This iterative cycle continued until the project was completed.

**Sharing of Source Code**
---------------
Github was the chosen method of sharing all source code for the Eventify application, which can be found in the SunRecognizeLaughter repository,  in the GroupAssignment folder. Once a change was committed by a group member, it could be pushed to the repository, allowing the other group members to pull their changes. Github also has the ability to merge changes, which was extremely helpful when we had different commits from the same file. Tasks in the sprint were chosen and delegated taking into account which files would be used by each task, as it was undesirable to make different changes to the same file. However, this could sometimes not be avoided, and Github graciously handled the changes, which minimal affect to work flow.

**Version Control**
---------------
Git is an open-source distributed control system (Sridhar, 2018), which tracks and stores code in repositories. Because parts of the code were being altered in parallel, version control was necessary to ensure consistency and avoid code conflicts. This system is distributed to both a remote repository and a local repository, meaning the codebase is stored both on a remote server and locally on the developer's device. This allowed each team member to hold a working copy of the codebase, committing changes to the remote server, which could then be downloaded by other team members. Therefore, this ensured all team members were working on recent copies of the codebase, which enabled us to successfully avoid code conflicts. Github is one of the most common version control systems available, and was used by SunRecognizeLaughter to complete this project. The Github Desktop application was used by the group, as it provides a simple interface that allowed us to easily and regularly push and pull commits to the project.
